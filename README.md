# track-task-time

A tool to track the time of tasks. The `ttt` CLI provides explicit start/stop and pause/resume commands, stores data locally in JSON, and reports daily totals.

## Disclaimer

I use this project as a playground to get familiar with how to use agentic AI capabilities to delegate programming tasks.
Most to all of the code is generated by AI.

## ttt CLI

`ttt` is a small, cross-platform CLI for tracking task time with explicit start/stop and pause/resume commands.

### Features

- Start/stop a single active task at a time.
- Pause/resume without splitting a task into multiple tasks.
- Daily report aggregated by task name (case-insensitive).
- JSON storage; no network or sync.

### Usage

```
ttt [--data-file <path>] <command>
```

### Commands

- `start <task>`: Start tracking a task. Prompts if a task is active or paused.
- `stop`: Stop the active or paused task.
- `pause`: Pause the active task.
- `resume`: Resume the paused task.
- `status`: Show the current task and elapsed time.
- `location`: Show the data file location.
- `report`: Show today’s totals (default: today).

### Examples

```
ttt start "Write docs"
ttt pause
ttt resume
ttt status
ttt report
ttt stop
```

### Data File

- Default location: OS-specific user data directory, e.g. `~/.local/share/ttt/ttt.json` on Linux.
- Override with `--data-file /path/to/ttt.json`.

### Output Format

- Durations are printed as `HH:MM:SS`.
- Report lines look like `Task Name - 01:12:05`.

## Development Setup

### Build the CLI

```bash
cargo build
```

### Run tests

```bash
cargo test
```

Unit tests cover formatting and aggregation logic.

## Release Process

1) Update `app/Cargo.toml` version and add entries to `CHANGELOG.md`.
2) Commit the changes to `main`.
3) Create and push a tag:

```bash
git tag vX.Y.Z
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

Pushing the tag triggers the GitHub Actions release workflow to build binaries and publish release notes from the changelog.

### Building the container image

```bash
docker build . -t track-task-time:0.1.3
```

### Running and attaching to the container image

```bash
docker container run -d -it --rm --mount type=bind,src=./,dst=/app track-task-time:0.1.4 bash
docker attach <CONTAINER_ID/NAME>
```
